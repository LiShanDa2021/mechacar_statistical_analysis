# Mechacar Statistical Analysis

AutosRU's much anticipated Mechacar has run into production trouble and it is up to my team identify precisely where that trouble lies. To do so we ran several statistical analyses to see what was causing the trouble. The results of three statistical tests and the design of a proposed study to test Mechacar against the competition are outlined below.

## 1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## 2. Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
